# For Loop
<br/>

## Repeat strings in an Array
if we have an array of strings, we can print each string out like this
```swift
import SwiftUI

let platforms = ["iOS", "macOS", "watchOS", "tvOS"]

for os in platforms {
    print("Swift works great on \(os).")
}
```
```python
Swift works great on iOS.
Swift works great on macOS.
Swift works great on watchOS.
Swift works great on tvOS.
```

## Loop over a fixed range of numbers.
```swift
for i in 1...12 {
    print("5 x \(i) = \(i * 5)")
}
```
```python
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
5 x 6 = 30
5 x 7 = 35
5 x 8 = 40
5 x 9 = 45
5 x 10 = 50
5 x 11 = 55
5 x 12 = 60
```

## Nested Loops, we can also put loops inside loops.
```swift
for i in 1...3 {
    print("The \(i) times table:")
    
    for j in 1...5 {
    print(" \(i) x \(j) = \(i * j)")
    }
    
    print() //this helps break up our output so it looks nicer on the secreen. just add a new line.
}
```

```swift
The 1 times table:
 1 x 1 = 1
 1 x 2 = 2
 1 x 3 = 3
 1 x 4 = 4
 1 x 5 = 5

The 2 times table:
 2 x 1 = 2
 2 x 2 = 4
 2 x 3 = 6
 2 x 4 = 8
 2 x 5 = 10

The 3 times table:
 3 x 1 = 3
 3 x 2 = 6
 3 x 3 = 9
 3 x 4 = 12
 3 x 5 = 15
``` 


## ..<
this is a type of range that counts up to but excluding the final number. "..<" is really helpful for working with arrays, where we count from 0 and often want to count up to but excluding the number of items in the array. we'll see differences between "1...5" and "1..<5"

```swift
for i in 1...5 {
    print("Counting from 1 through 5: \(i)")
}

for i in 1..<5 {
    print("counting from 1 upto 5: \(i)")
}
```
```swift
Counting from 1 through 5: 1
Counting from 1 through 5: 2
Counting from 1 through 5: 3
Counting from 1 through 5: 4
Counting from 1 through 5: 5
counting from 1 upto 5: 1
counting from 1 upto 5: 2
counting from 1 upto 5: 3
counting from 1 upto 5: 4
```

## _
when we don't actually want the loop variable, we can replace it with and underscore_.
```swift
var lyric = "Haters gonna"
for _ in 1...3 {
    lyric += " hate,"
}
print(lyric)
```
```python
Haters gonna hate, hate, hate,
```

we can use it in this way too.
```swift
let count = 1...3
for _ in count {
    print("There's no place like home.")
}
```
```python
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
```

<br/>

# While loop
## While loop will continually execute the loop body until the condition is false.
```swift
var countdown = 10

while countdown > 0 {
    print("\(countdown)...")
    countdown -= 1
}

print("Blast off!")
```

```swift
10...
9...
8...
7...
6...
5...
4...
3...
2...
1...
Blast off!
```

## Random. Create a new random interger or decimal.
```swift
let id = Int.random(in: 1...10000)
print(id)

let amount = Double.random(in: 0...5)
print(amount)
```

```swift
3076
3.406257562896402
```

## While loop with random functionality.
Let's roll some virtual 6 sided dice again and again, ending the loop only when a 5 is rolled.
```swift
var roll = 0 create an integer to store our roll

while roll != 5 {
    roll = Int.random(in: 1...6)
    print("I rolled a \(roll)")
}
print("Finally 5!")
```
```python
I rolled a 2
I rolled a 3
I rolled a 4
I rolled a 5
Finally 5!
```

loops that prints 5 lines of text.
```swift
var counter = 2
while counter < 64 {
    print("\(counter) is a 2")
    counter *= 2
}
```
```python
2 is a 2
4 is a 2
8 is a 2
16 is a 2
32 is a 2
```


```swift
var page: Int = 0
while page < 5 {
    page += 1
    print("I'm reading page \(page).")
}
```
```swift
I'm reading page 1.
I'm reading page 2.
I'm reading page 3.
I'm reading page 4.
I'm reading page 5.
```


```swift
var cats: Int = 0
while cats < 10 {
    cats += 1
    print("I'm getting another cat.")
    if cats == 4 {
        print("Enough cats.")
        cats = 10
    }
}
```
```swift
I'm getting another cat.
I'm getting another cat.
I'm getting another cat.
I'm getting another cat.
Enough cats.
```

# Continue, Break. How to Skip loop items

## Continue,if we call "continue" inside the loop body, Swift will immediately stop executing the current loop iteration and jump to the next item in the loop, where it will carry on as normal.
```swift
let filenames = ["my photo.jpg", "Work.txt", "someone.jpg", "logo.psd"]

for filename in filenames {
    if filename.hasSuffix(".jpg") == false {
        continue
    }
    print("Found Picture: \(filename)")
}
```
```python
Found Picture: my photo.jpg
Found Picture: someone.jpg
```

## Break, that exits a loop immediately and skips all remaining iterations. 
```swift
let number1 = 4
let number2 = 14
var multiples = [Int]()

for i in 1...100000 {
    if i.isMultiple(of: number1) && i.isMultiple(of: number2) {
        multiples.append(i)
        
        if multiples.count == 10 {
            break
        }
    }
}
print(multiples)
```
```python
[28, 56, 84, 112, 140, 168, 196, 224, 252, 280]
```
