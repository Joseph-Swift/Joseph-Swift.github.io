# Functions

Functions are just Chunks of code, and we give a name so we can refer to them easily. Functions are designed to let us reuse code easily, which means we don't have to copy and paste code to get common behaviors. so we can use it again and again. reuse it elsewhere.
we can make a function, name it with parenthesis (). we have to put () at the end. Cos we ask Swift to run its code.
```swift
func showWelcome() {
    print("Welcome to my app!")
    print("By default this prints out a conversion")
}

showWelcome()
``` 

isMultiple(of: ) is also a function that belongs
```swift
let number = 139

if number.isMultiple(of: 2) {
    print("Even")
} else {
    print("Odd")
}
```

random() is a function too.
```swift
let roll = Int.random(in: 1...20)
print(roll)
```
<br/>

so they are the function Apple have made. And we can make our own functions that are open to configuration, all by putting extra code in between the parentheses.
we will place "number: Int" inside the parentheses. That's called a **"parameter"**, and it's our customize point. 
```swift
func printTimesTables(number: Int) {
    for i in 1...5 {
        print("\(number) x \(i) is \(number * i)")
    }
}
printTimesTables(number: 3)
```

we can even make **multiple parameters**. For example, we can customize ho high our multiplication tables go, we might make the end of our range be set using a second parameter.
```swift
func printTimesTables2(number: Int, end: Int) {
    for i in 1...end {
        print("\(number) x \(i) is \(number * i)")
    }
}
printTimesTables2(number: 4, end: 2)
```
