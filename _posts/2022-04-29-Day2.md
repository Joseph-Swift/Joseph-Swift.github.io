# Boolean
We are gonna look at **Boolean**, which stores either true or false. 
```swift
let number1 = 120
print(number1.isMultiple(of: 3))

let filename1 = "paris.jpg"
print(filename1.hasSuffix(".jpg"))
```

Both 'isMultiple(of:_)' and ' hasSuffix' return a new value based on their check the string has the suffix or it doesn't. in both places there's always a simple "true or false answer, which is where Booleans come in. they store just that, and nothing else.
```swift
var gameOver = false
print(gameOver)
```

Booleans have only one special operator, !, which mean "not". this flips a Boolean's value from true to false, or false to true. 
```swift
var something = false
something = !something
print(something)
```

that will print 'true' then 'false' when it runs, because something started as false, and we set it to not false, which is true. Now Let's flip it again
```swift
something = !something
print(something)
```

Now that prints 'false'. Booleans have a little extra functionality that we call '.toggle()'
```swift
var gamesOver = false
print(gameOver)

gameOver.toggle()
print(gameOver)
```
That will print false, then after calling .toggle() will print true. that's the same as using !

## How to join strings together. use + to do it. 
```swift
let firstPart = "Hello, "
let secondPart = "world!"
let greeting1 = firstPart + secondPart
print(greeting1)
```

we can do this many times
```swift
let people = "Good people"
let action = "love each other"
let lyrics = people + " gonna " + action
print(lyrics)
```
# String interpolation, How to put "Code" inside a String
Put \(code) in the String
we gonna use string interpolation now. Becasue it's much more efficient than using +. we could create one sting constant and one integer constant, then combine them into a new string
```swift
let myName = "Joseph"
let age = 56
//let message = "Hi, my name is" + myName + "and I'm" age "years old."    -not good.
let message = "Hi, my name is \(myName) and I'm \(age) years old."
print(message)
```

```siwft
print("Hello \(2+3) world")
print("The result of 4 + 5 = \(4 + 5)")
```
<h4>Hello 5 world
The result of 4 + 5 = 9<h4>

we can put calculations inside string interpolation if we want to
```swift
print("5 x 5 is \(5 * 5)")
```

[**Checkpoint!**]
{: .notice--danger}
We're gonna convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Your goal is to write  code that:

1. Creates a constant holding any temperature in Celsius.
2. Converts it to Fahrenheit by multiplying by 9, dividing by 5, then adding 32.
3. Prints the result for the user, showing both the Celsius and Fahrenheit values.

```swift    
let celsius = 20.2
let fahrenheit = celsius * 9 / 5 + 32
print("Celsius is \(celsius)°C, and Fahrenheit is \(fahrenheit)°F.") 
//we can use Option + Shift + 8 to get the degrees symbol:°.
```
